WELCOME TO THE KITCHEN!
For the visitor to the site, you will find the table set with options of our four major categories of recipes: Cookies and Candies, Cakes and Puddings, Pies, and Quick-breads. Clicking one of these buttons will pull up a card for each recipe of the category in the field below.

One of these recipes catch your eye? Click on the card and it will direct you to the specific details for this recipe, along with a brief story about this recipe's history or its place in our family's culinary tradition. On the right-hand side of this page you will find an easy navigation tool to jump to the different sections of the page.

If you like what you see or you made it and want to let the world know how it turned out, you can leave a comment at the bottom of the page along with a star rating. No need to create an account, just sign it however you like.

Tired of looking at this recipe? Click the home button in the top right corner and it will take you back to the previous spread, already filtered for your continued browsing.


ADMIN Features
If you're the site administrator, you can access the admin tools by adding 
/admin to the root. (i.e. countrykitchen/admin) This brings you to a simple log-in screen. Once you have logged in, you will see buttons for the administration option at the top of the page. Using these buttons, you can add recipes (from the front page), edit a recipe (from the recipe's page), and edit or delete (from the recipe's page).

Happy baking!
